/**
 * This class implements a platform independent auto-assist roller intake subsystem. It contains one or two motors
 * and optionally one or two sensors that detects the position of the object. It provides the autoAssist methods
 * that allow the caller to intake or eject objects on a press of a button and the intake subsystem will automatically
 * grab the object once it is within grasp. While it provides the auto-assist functionality to intake or eject
 * objects, it also supports exclusive subsystem access by implementing TrcExclusiveSubsystem. This enables the
 * intake subsystem to be aware of multiple callers' access to the subsystem. While one caller starts the subsystem
 * for an operation, nobody can access it until the previous caller is done with the operation.
